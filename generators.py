#### Generators
# Generators are a simpler way to create iterators. They use the yield keyword to produce a series of values lazily, which means they generate values on the fly and do not store them in memory.

def square(n):
    for i in range(3):
        yield i**2
square(3)


for i in square(3):
    print(i)
a=square(3)
a
next(a)


def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen=my_generator()
gen
next(gen)

# Practical Example: Reading Large Files
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path,'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line

file_path='large_file.txt'
for line in read_large_file(file_path):
    print(line.strip())
